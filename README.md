# Webpack-Template

## Description
This is my own current webpack template. This is what currently works for my needs and I will expand as needed.

Anything that is not needed should be removed from `package.json` file, as well as, `webpack.config.js`.

Run `npm install` in terminal to have a setup webpack template.
